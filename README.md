Task Manager (Console-Based)

A simple console-based task manager aplication that helps users add, view,modify and delete tasks. It's a small project that I made to test my knowledge in OOP languages like C++ or Java.


Features:

-Add new tasks

-View the list of tasks

-Modify tasks(Name,Duration,Mark them as 'Completed' or 'Work-In-Progress',Coefficient of priority)

-Delete tasks

-Recommend the most important task to be done


The program has been made in C++,a language I've been familiar with for over 6 years.
Although I've been coding in this language from the age of 15, I still learned new concepts like the "screen wipe" ANSI escape sequance and 'this_thread' & 'sleep_for' for a more dynamic and old-fashioned look on small computer program.
Learning new things besides encapsulation and data variables types is truly intresting, and I'll continue to make small-to-medium sized projects to familiarize myself with both the working enviroment and the coding languages aswell.


Future implementations will definetely have graphical interface and/or a database storage,and if I will make a v2.0.0(which I'll probably try and do),I''l try to add due dates,and depending of them and coefficient of priority,conclude the best task to start with.
